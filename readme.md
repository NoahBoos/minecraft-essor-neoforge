# Welcome to Essor's GitHub Page!

Welcome, fellow Minecraftian! This is Essor's GitHub page, where you'll find everything related to the mod. But before diving in… what exactly is Essor?

## What is Essor?

Essor is a Minecraft mod initially developed for version 1.21.1. It introduces a brand-new way to upgrade your tools. Inspired by classics like *Tinker's Construct* and *Level Tools*, Essor enhances your gameplay by adding a leveling system to your equipment.

Unlike most plugins and mods that implement equipment leveling, Essor is designed to provide you with a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience.

## A leveling system…?

Yes! The leveling system in Essor gives players a fun, time-friendly way to earn enchanted gear and rewards.

Each type of equipment has its own way to gain experience:

- **Tools** gain experience by performing their primary action (breaking blocks) or secondary/tertiary actions (pathing ground, shearing sheep, tilling soil, etc.).
- **Weapons** gain experience by killing mobs. The amount of experience depends on the weapon used:
    - Killing a ghast with a sword will grant you less experience than killing it with a bow.
    - Killing underwater mobs is more effective for leveling up your trident than your sword.
    - Killing a zombie benefits your sword more than your mace.
- **Armor** gains experience by taking damage — the more damage you take, the more experience it earns.

Every time a piece of equipment levels up, its durability is fully restored. At certain levels, equipment will also gain enchantments and grant you items.

## The Reward System

Essor introduces a unique reward system for leveling up your equipment: each level-up can provide enchantments or items.

### How does the enchantment reward system work?

Since Minecraft already defines certain enchantment compatibilities, Essor applies enchantments according to those rules. It also follows specific game design choices to prevent players from becoming overpowered.

#### Mending

Mending is a very powerful enchantment — and often the one players seek the most. However, Essor does **not** grant Mending automatically when leveling up your gear.

This design choice may be reconsidered in future updates.

#### Protection-like, Sharpness-like, Trident, Mace, and Crossbow enchantments

To prevent gear from becoming too overpowered, you cannot get all “protection-like” enchantments on the same armor piece. When you first earn a protection-like enchantment, a randomizer chooses between *Protection*, *Blast Protection*, *Fire Protection*, or *Projectile Protection*. 

It is the same system for *Sharpness*, *Smite* and *Bane of Arthropods*. The randomizer also gets triggered when it comes Trident, Mace and Crossbow enchantments, since some of those are also following these enchantment compatibilities defined by Minecraft.

### How does the item reward system work?

At certain levels, players are granted items.  
If your inventory has space, the item will be placed directly inside. If your inventory is full, it will drop at your feet.
